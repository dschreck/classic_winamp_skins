# Classic Winamp Skins, circa 2002(?)

I've had this collection of classic Winamp Skins floating around on backup CDs, then backup DVDs, then backup harddrives for awhile now. 

I'm finally ready to delete it from my storage devices, but I thought I'd go ahead and share the files in case anyone else was interested in a piece of internet / winamp history.

These skins were downloaded in my teenage years, and it was one of the coolest things to be able to customize my media player of choice.
